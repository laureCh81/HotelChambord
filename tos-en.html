<p>5. The booking process comprises the following steps:</p>

<p><b><br>
7.&nbsp;<b>Changes and cancellations made by the Client</b></b><br>
</p>
<p>1. Clients are reminded that in accordance with Article L. 221-28-12 of the French Consumer Code, they do not enjoy the right of withdrawal set out in Article L. 221-18 of the Consumer Code.</p>

<p>3. Curtailed or interrupted stays that feature a prepaid booking at a non-refundable and binding rate cannot be refunded.</p>
<p>4. In cases where the terms and conditions for the rate booked permit it:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cancellations for bookings made via the Website can be made directly in the Website’s “Your Bookings” section, or directly with the Hôtel Barrière in question. For bookings made via the booking centre or directly with an Hôtel Barrière, cancellations can only be made directly with the Hôtel Barrière in question.</li>
<li>Changes to bookings can be made directly with the Hôtel Barrière, the telephone number for which can be found on the booking email sent to the Client.</li>
</ul>
<p>In the event of a no-show, meaning a booking that is not cancelled, but where the Client nonetheless fails to check in at the Hôtel Barrière on the day booked, where the booking was secured via bank card details or prepayment, the Hôtel Barrière in question will debit the amount for one booked night, or will retain the amount prepaid. For stays where multiple nights are booked, the cancellations terms apply in accordance with the terms and conditions for the rate booked.<br>
<br>
</p>
<p><b>8.&nbsp;Cancellation made by the Hotel&nbsp;<br>
 </b><br>
In exceptional circumstances or cases where it is impossible to provide the Client with their booked room, or in the event of force majeure, the Hôtel Barrière booked will offer the Client an alternative accommodation solution in a hotel that is of at least equal standing to the booked hotel, in a room of superior category to the one originally booked, with equivalent services. Any potential additional costs related to these changes in accommodation for services of the same value shall be paid for by the original Hôtel Barrière booked. The Client may also opt to cancel their booking, resulting in an immediate refund.<br>
</p>
<p><b><br>
9.&nbsp;<b>&nbsp;Staying at Hôtels Barrière</b></b><br>
</p>
<p>1. All guests staying overnight at the establishment are required to show valid proof of identity. If a guests fails to do so, Hôtels Barrière may refuse to provide them with a room and/or cancel their booking, with no right to a refund where applicable, in accordance with the terms and conditions for the rate booked.</p>
<p>Non-French guests, including clients’ guests and teenagers over the age of fifteen, are required to fill in a mandatory ‘police reference form’. Minors under the age of fifteen may be included on the form filled in by the adult accompanying them. The information contained in this form is governed by the “Entry Code for Foreign National Stays and Rights to Asylum”, Article R.611-42.</p>
<p>Clients may only invite third parties to their room following the Hôtel Barrière's express approval, with the establishment reserving the right to conduct any necessary checks.</p>
<p>2. Cats and dogs are welcome provided they are kept on a lead in all communal areas of the establishment, it being understood that the Hôtel Barrière reserves the right to refuse access to all types of pets and animals in the event of a threat to other occupants’ safety, with this threat remaining at the Hôtel Barrière's discretion. For reasons of hygiene, animals are not permitted in the restaurant areas (this provision does not apply to assistance and guide dogs). In order to safeguard peace of mind for all guests, animals must not be left alone without surveillance.</p>
<p>An add-on fee per animal may be billed. For further details, we invite you to consult the Website's Hotel fact sheet for the terms and conditions that apply.</p>
<p>3. Clients accept and undertake to use their room and the shared spaces available in a reasonable fashion. Any conduct that is contrary to health and/or safety, public decency and/or order may lead to the Hôtel Barrière asking the Client to leave the establishment, with no refund possible.</p>
<p>4. Any damage caused by the Client or the occupants under their responsibility, whether in their room or in the various spaces used by them, must be flagged at the hotel reception or to the manager, and may be directly billed to the Client in question.</p>
<p>For health and safety reasons, and to ensure comfort for all our guests, smoking is strictly prohibited inside the hotel. In compliance with the French public health code and its provisions surrounding smoking bans in collective spaces, smoking inside the hotel may result in a third-category fine or legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Penalties equivalent to the price of the booked room may be applied if a Client fails to comply with the smoking ban notices displayed in their rooms, if such a notice is in place.</p>
<p>5. Hôtels Barrière has a series of <u><a href="/content/dam/hotels/visuels-site-national/informations-legales/reglement-interieur/reglement-interieur-definitif-uk.pdf" target="_blank">Internal Rules</a></u> Clients are required to abide by. Clients accept and undertake to comply with these rules and regulations, the provisions of which apply to both the Client themselves and any of their guests. Should the provisions of these rules be breached, the Hôtel Barrière may elect to immediately remove the Client and any associated occupants with no compensation and/or refund if payment has already been made. They may equally deny them any future bookings, in all other Hôtels Barrière establishments.</p>
<p>6. Unless expressly stated to the contrary, the Client must vacate their room before noon on the last day of their booking. Failure to do so shall result in an additional night being billed.</p>
<p><b><br>
10.&nbsp;Guarantees<br>
 </b><br>
The Hotels are required to guarantee compliance and conformity of their Services with the terms and conditions outlined in Articles L. 212-1 et seq. of the French Consumer Code.</p>
<p><b><br>
11.&nbsp;Liability<br>
 </b><br>
1. The photographs shown on the Website are not contractually binding. Although every effort is made to ensure the photographs, graphic depictions and texts used to illustrate the Hotels on offer provide as accurate a glimpse as possible of the accommodation available, variations or discrepancies may exist, notably due to changes in furniture and furnishings or any potential renovations that may take place. This cannot give rise to any rights or claims.</p>
<p>2. In compliance with the laws and regulations governing intellectual property rights, the full or partial use and/or reproduction of elements that comprise the Barrière offers showcased on the Website is strictly prohibited, as is any reproduction of Hôtels Barrière’s décor and/or trademark characteristics.</p>
<p>In order to respect other Hôtels Barrière Clients’ right to privacy and image rights, Clients are prohibited from photographing them within the hotel or on its premises and/or from publishing photographs taken in the aforementioned conditions.</p>
<p>3. The Groupe Lucien Barrière cannot be held responsible for any direct or indirect damages caused by a third party, Client or Hôtels Barrière partners.</p>
<p>4. Hyperlinks may redirect to websites other than the Groupe Lucien Barrière's Websites. The Group assumes no liability with respect to the content of said websites and the Services offered. Both the Chambord Hotel have put in place protection and security measures to safeguard their information system from any malicious activities. However, in logging on to the Website and making a booking, the Client implicitly acknowledges and accepts the characteristics and limitations of the Internet, the absence of protection from some data potentially being intercepted or hacked, or the potential risk of viruses on the network. Both the Chambord Hotel decline all responsibility in the event of misuse or incidents related to using a computer or any device for the purposes of accessing the Internet, for the maintenance or malfunctioning of the Website or any other technical connection, and for sending details to the wrong address.</p>
<p>5. Any booking or payment deemed improper, invalid, incomplete or fraudulent for which the Client is responsible shall result in the order being cancelled at the Client’s expense, notwithstanding any civil or criminal action taken against the latter.</p>
<p>6. Hôtels Barrière reserves the right to refuse service to Clients in indecent or inappropriate attire, in clothing that conceals the face (Law n°2010-119 dated 11 October 2010),<br>
Clients with a noisy or disruptive demeanour, Clients under the influence of alcohol, and Clients whose behaviour or conduct are contrary to public decency and order. Proper attire is required in the Hotel's restaurants and public spaces.</p>
<p>Clients are requested to remain courteous and respectful in their dealings with Hotel staff. Clients undertake to abstain from any verbal or physical violence, racist speech and conduct, and any form of harassment and intimidation.</p>
<p><b><br>
12. Prices</b></p>
<p>1. Prices for booking Services are given prior to and upon booking.</p>
<p>2. Displayed prices are given per room for the stated number of guests and chosen date(s). Unless otherwise specified, additional Services (breakfasts, half-board, full-board, etc.) are not included in the given price. Upon confirmation of the Client's booking, the total amount for the Services booked shall be stated.</p>
<p>Prices given include VAT applicable on the day on which the booking was made, and any changes to the VAT rate shall automatically be applied to the prices given on the date of invoicing.</p>
<p>3. Clients are given prices inclusive of all taxes, in the Hotel’s trading currency (Euros), which may differ from the establishment's local currency in some cases. The prices given are only valid for a set period of time. All bookings are payable in the Hotel’s local currency.</p>
<p>4. If a given price implies that payment will need to be made at the Hôtel Barrière in a currency other than that stated on the booking, exchange costs (conversion and bank fees) remain the Client’s responsibility. Please note that if the currency shown on the booking has been converted to a different currency, this is provided for indicative purposes only and is not legally binding, given the potential for exchange rates to fluctuate between the date of booking and the date of the stay in the establishment.</p>
<p>5. Tourist taxes and any other taxes specific to the terms of each booking are payable in person at the Hotel reception, except if the booking is prepaid online, in which case the amount can be included in the payment.</p>
<p>6. In the event that new regulatory or legal taxes are brought in or changed by the authorities, these amounts shall automatically be added to the prices stated on the date of invoicing. Depending on the cities or countries involved, prices may not include various taxes. The Client will be informed of these taxes upon booking if the Hotel is aware of them at that time. Should the Hotel not be aware of them upon booking, they shall be displayed at the reception desk of the Hôtel Barrière in question. The Client undertakes to pay the various taxes to the booked Hôtel Barrière without question or objection.</p>
<p>7. Hôtels Barrière guarantees that the prices displayed on the Website are the best available prices. If, after having booked a Hôtel Barrière on the Website and within the 24 hours following their booking, the Client finds an equivalent offer for the same date(s) at a lower rate for the same Hotel, for the same number of guests and same type of room, the same Services (breakfast, etc.) for the same conditions of sale (cancellation and refund terms) on another Website (excepting exceptions), not including tourist taxes but including booking fees, Hôtels Barrière undertakes to match this price with an additional 10% discount.</p>
<p>The terms and conditions for this guarantee are outlined in detail at https.//Hôtelsbarriere.com/fr/meilleur-prix-garanti-conditions.html.&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><br>
13.&nbsp;Payment<br>
 </b><br>
<br>
1. The Client is required to provide payment details either (i) to prepay their booking ahead of the stay, or (ii) as a booking guarantee in the event of a no-show. With respect to bank cards, the details required are: The bank card number without spaces between the digits, the validity date (it being specified that the bank card used must be valid at the time of the stay) and the three-digit security code for prepayments.</p>
<p>Hôtels Barrière has chosen to use A.T.O.S (Payment Service Provider) for secure online bank card payment via 3D Secure. The Client’s payment card will undergo security checks (outstanding amount check, bank card country check, IP address country check, etc.) by the designated partner, and may be refused for several reasons: Stolen or blocked card, maximum limit reached, input error, etc. In the event of any issues, the Client will need to contact both their bank and the establishment or any other entity in order to confirm the Service booking and the payment method used.</p>
<p>Online payment methods include Visa, Mastercard and American Express cards. This list may be amended.</p>
<p>2. Payment is debited at the Hôtel Barrière during the stay, unless under special terms and conditions or for special prices where payment is taken upon booking (some rates require prepayment).</p>
<p>3. When booking a stay with the booking centre or establishment for an amount over €5,000, the Client will always be asked to make their payment by bank transfer.</p>
<p>Payment by transfer is also an option for lower amounts or when expressly requested by the Client.</p>
<p>4. In the event of payment on site at the Hôtel Barrière, each Hôtel Barrière may accept different payment methods, but the Client must always provide the establishment with the bank card used to make the booking or prepayment, as a way of confirming the Client’s identity. The Hôtel Barrière may also request the Client show proof of identity in order to prevent bank card fraud.</p>
<p>If the Client has not prepaid for their stay, the establishment shall ask the Client upon arrival for a guarantee deposit or authorisation to debit their bank card with a view to guaranteeing the stay for a total of all booked nights with the addition of an extra €100 per person and per day in order to cover guarantee for any extras. This same guarantee shall be required from all third-party guests.</p>
<p>If the Client has prepaid for their stay, the establishment may ask the Client for a fixed rate of €100 per person and per day to cover guarantee for any extras.</p>
<p>For sales made over the phone, the Client will be asked to sign the receipt upon arriving at the Hôtel Barrière.</p>
<p>5. In the event of a no-show, meaning a booking that is not cancelled, but where the Client nonetheless fails to check in at the Hôtel Barrière on the day booked, where the booking was secured via bank card, the Hôtel Barrière in question will debit the amount for one booked night to recoup the cost of a no-show. If multiple nights were booked, the cancellation terms and conditions for the rate booked apply.</p>
<p>6. Upon prepaying, the amount debited upon booking&nbsp; includes: The price of the accommodation, accommodation-related taxes, the price of food and drink if breakfast is requested, food and drink-related taxes and any other additional services selected by the Client, excluding tourist taxes and/or any other taxes related to the Client staying at the Hotel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>2. The computerised records stored in the Groupe Lucien Barrière computer systems are kept in reasonable security conditions and considered to be proof of communication, orders and payments made between the parties.</p>
<p><b><br>
16.&nbsp;<b>Force majeure</b></b><br>
</p>
<p>Groupe Lucien Barrière subsidiaries, the company SFCMC and its subsidiaries, and all other Barrière brand-affiliated companies cannot be held responsible by the Client in the event that they fail to fulfil their obligations as a result of force majeure.</p>
<p>Similarly, Groupe Lucien Barrière subsidiaries, the company SFCMC and its subsidiaries, and all other Barrière brand-affiliated companies cannot hold the Client responsible should the latter fail to fulfil their obligations as a result of force majeure.</p>
<p>Unforeseeable circumstances or force majeure are those generally recognised by the case law of the French courts and tribunals.</p>
<p>The Hôtel Barrière booked will offer the Client an alternative accommodation solution in a hotel that is of at least equal standing to the booked hotel, or in the event of an inferior category, in a room of superior category to the one originally booked, with equivalent services. Any potential additional costs related to these changes in accommodation for services of the same value shall be paid for by the original Hôtel Barrière establishment booked. The Client may also opt to cancel their booking, resulting in an immediate refund.<br>
<br>
<b><br>
 17.&nbsp;<b>Applicable law</b></b><br>
</p>
<p>1. These general terms and conditions of sale are governed by French law.</p>
<p>2. This applies for both basic rules and for the rules governing their form.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<b>18. Full obligations</b></p>
<p>1. These general terms and conditions of sale, the terms and conditions for the rate booked by the Client and the booking confirmation comprise the full and integral obligations of both parties.</p>
<p>2. No general or special conditions expressed by the Client can be incorporated into these general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>3. The documents constituting the parties’ contractual obligations are, in descending order of importance, the booking confirmation or request (complete with special conditions for the rate booked) approved by the Client and these general terms and conditions.</p>
<p>4. In the event of conflict between the booking confirmation and these general terms and conditions, the provisions given on the booking confirmation shall prevail as the only provisions applicable.</p>
<p><br>
<b>19. Mediation</b></p>
